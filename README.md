# Cryptora
Cryptora is a secure offline text encryption system in Java that uses RSA key pairs for end-to-end encryption. Users can register, send encrypted messages, and decrypt received messagesâ€”all locally. It ensures privacy by allowing only the recipient to decrypt messages, making it ideal for secure, offline communication.
